0) Profile contains all the basic information such as Name, Address,
   E-Mail, etc.

1) Master Resume is not a resume that you would probably send with an
   application. It will contain *all* the information about your
   qualifications and experience. For a given job, you would pick
   certain sections and likely edit them to create a Custom
   Resume. Note that you can save multiple Custom Resumes once you
   have created them. They will be re-usable for different jobs.

2) Cover Letter Templates. You can create multiple Templates. The
   fields will be automatically filled when you create a Custom Cover
   Letter using one of them.

Create/Edit Master Resume

  - Profile Summary
  - Skills
  - Work Record
    -- Organization/Company
    -- Place
    -- Time Period
    -- Role
    -- Duties
    -- Recognitions
  - Community Involvement
  - Personal Achievements
  - References

Notes: When creating a custom resume, you will pick sections from the
       Master Resume and assemble into one document and maybe edit.

       When creating a Custom Resume, each section of the Master
       Resume will have a check box that allows you to pick which
       sections to include in the Custom Resume.

       As the user might change the content of the resume from time to
       time, it is important to record a *version* of the Master
       Resume. (Use svn to store different versions??)

Create/Edit Cover Letter Template

  - Letter Body

    Save button (can give different names to save as)

Notes: Only the letter body needs to be entered. The address and other
       personal information is automatically taken from the Profile
       whereas the addressee is taken from the Job Entry for the
       particular job.

       You can use Field Names, such as Company Name (defined in the
       Job Record) within the body.

       When preparing a Cover Letter for a particular job, you select
       a particular Cover Letter Template. That will create a Custom
       Cover Letter for that job.

Create Resume

  - Display Master Resume with checkboxes
  - Allows giving a name. Internally, there will be only one resume
    and different versions of it. The name given here will be
    associated with a version numver.

    Create button creates a customized resume and displays it.
    There are number of different options for display: 1) as text 2)
    as an HTML file 3) as a PDF file

    The displayed file can be printed and/or downloaded to local
    computer and edited if necessary (only works with text or HTML
    formats).

Notes: 
  1) The resume will be saved in HTML format only.
  2) The user can create any number of Resumes and save them. They
     will be available for selection when applying for a job.
  3) In addition, there should be possibility of uploading resumes
     created by other means (like a Word document created on the local
     PC.) They will also be listed for selection.

Job Entry Record

  - Company/Organization
  - Address
  - Phone
  - Fax
  - Position
  - Last Action
  - LA Date
  - Next Action
  - NA Date
  - ActivityHistory (multiple activities)
  - Version of Cover Letter Sent (retrieved from Revision Control System)
  - Version of Resume Sent (retrieved from Revision Control System)

Notes: When an application (cover letter and resume) is sent, both of
       them are stored in a revision control system by names
       <uid>_cover.html and <uid>_resume.html. Thus it is important
       that, after an application has been submitted (i.e., as soon as
       the Status has changed to 'Applied'), no changes are allowed.
