ToDo

  - as it is, we cannot test e-mail sending. Implement this on Visva's
    vServer. 

User Registration
=================

One of the basic requirements of this (and any similar) application is
that there must be a mechanism to allow users to register in order to
access the service. Few things that are basic:

  - user registers accepting 'terms of use'
  - system sends a mail asking user to activate the account
  - user follows the link to activate accout
  - user logs in
  - if user has forgotten password, he/she can request a password
    reset
  - user can change password at any time

Django's auth system and the add-on 'registration' application provides the
required functionality.

The version 0.7 of django-registration was installed. In order to use
the functionality, it requires you to write a number of template
files. Used the files found in the article 

  http://devdoodles.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/user-authentication-with-django-registration/

as a starting point. However, a number of things needed to be
adjusted:

  - In each form template, the new {% csrf_token %} variable had to be
    included to conform with cross-site scripting prevention.

  - In jslog app a new view (IndexView) was created. The idea is to
    facilitate displaying a template without going through a view
    'function'. In the base.html file, {% url index %} was changed to
    {% url "/" %} to stop the error. Need to understand what is going
    on...
